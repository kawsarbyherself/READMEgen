// I was to create a README generator for this week assignment

according to acceptance criteria I made a gitignore file downloaded package.json and package-lock.json

Type in the command node index.js to start generating your README file 

after that you'll be presented with some questions about your README like the project name, description,license, usage etc... 

you'll be asked for your email and GitHub username. so in the readme preview it'll automatically give your Github profile link! 

youur all set with your Readme file :)
